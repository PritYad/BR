I have made following assumptions in my code:
1) Organisation name will not be null or undefined.
2) Organisation date will not be null or undefined and will come as formatted in dd/mm/yyyy from json.
3) Was not sure how to display status based on deviationFromTimetable so have made following assumption for displaying it:
    i) On time is deviationFromTimetable is greater than 0 and less than 300.
    ii) Late is deviationFromTimetable is greater than 300.
    iii) Early is deviationFromTimetable is less than 0.
    iv) Unknown if deviationFromTimetable is null or undefined or unknown.
4) Spinner and success message for Saving of notes is pending. Same for spinner on showing/hiding of busData.
5) Have written test cases only for BusComponent for now.
6) Due to limited time, have written css only for desktop version(Have written no media queries for now).
